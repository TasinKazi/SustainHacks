# SustainHacks
Inspiration
After eating lunch, I had lots of trash left over. After standing by a recycling bin and trash can, I was trying to figure out what goes where. After a quick Google search, I realized I had been recycling wrong. I had been guilty of a common problem called aspirational recycling, a phenomenon where people unknowingly miss recycling because it feels like the right thing to do. We understand how this is not harmless and lowers the quality and increases sorting person-hours of each haul.

‚ôªÔ∏è What it does
We decided to make a change in two critical ways:

Build an SMS chatbot to help determine the right way for consumers to dispose of trash/waste. Text what item you're unsure about, and it responds promptly.
We created a website that can give advice and product recommendations to reduce waste products before you need to recycle them properly.
We created a quiz to determine the level of sustainability in your life out of 100. The user can then share their score with friends.
üçÄ How we built it
We researched the problem and sketched an outline. Created the website on Velo by Wix and used html5/css3/ javascript to create an additional quiz website and integrate that on Wix. Build a chatbot on Twillo. Then hosted the quiz website on Microsoft Cloud. We used Domain.com to buy a domain for our website.

ü§î Challenges we ran into
Unfortunately, we had never used Microsoft Cloud but could use it for free with a student account. Also, with WIX we could not create everything we wanted, for example, the quiz feature of this website. We had to develop a custom solution that would fit this solution, which was quite challenging.

ü•á Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that our team was able to manage our time perfectly and come up with a product on time. Also, we were able to learn new skills and apply them to real-life situations properly.

üå± What we learned
Our team enjoyed learning about the sponsored products and solutions. Our team also learned to cooperate with each other and make the best project out of the skills we already have. We also learned to manage our quality of work and time well under timed conditions.

üîú What's next for Waste Less
We can work on expanding the function and services. If we were given more time, we would have implemented a back end to store the result of the quiz and make a leaderboard with it, to promote the users to increase their scores by doing good to the earth.
